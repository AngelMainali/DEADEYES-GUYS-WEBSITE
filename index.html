                  First & foremost we would like to congratulate all of our fellow brothers who‚Äôve qualified for the PMPL SA Regional finals.
                  We‚Äôve come so far not just because of our grind but also because of the constant support from you all who have all been our #1 motivators all along. Thank you for believing in us even on the days we weren‚Äôt at our best. Our love & respect goes out to each & every one of you.
                  In the arena it‚Äôs all about the sporting spirit at the end of the day. We‚Äôve been matched with the most amazing teams as rivals & their praiseworthy gameplay is something we would like to appreciate in this moment. Our other brothers who couldn‚Äôt qualify aren‚Äôt any less of a contender. They‚Äôve shown mind blowing performance nevertheless. Hard luck is temporary so we hope they will keep their spirits high.
                  It‚Äôs a team game & the team can only prosper if everybody‚Äôs wavelength matches as per the need of the moment. We might‚Äôve gone through some really challenging days but we wouldn‚Äôt be what we are if it wasn‚Äôt for our team synergy. Everybody‚Äôs role is equally important & the roaster did actually perform accordingly. Whenever one of us was at our 20% the other made sure they‚Äôd cover up with their gameplay. Deadeyes guys believe in themselves as well as each other.
                  Forever grateful for our supporters, the opportunities & last but not the least, our rivals who we treat as brothers.
                  We wish you good health. Sending positivity & strength.‚ù§Ô∏è
